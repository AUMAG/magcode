MAGCODE: models for calculating magnetic fields and interactions
================================================================

This repository contains code originally written for my PhD for calculating the forces
(and stiffnesses) between permanent magnets and arrays of magnets.

The GitHub repository for this code is located at: <https://github.com/wspr/magcode>

It has been originally written in Matlab and a little Mathematica,
and I plan on adding translations into other programming languages as time permits.
Contributions happily accepted.


Philosophy
----------

As time goes by, it becomes increasingly difficult to build on the work of our
predecessors unless we build tools to abstract the ideas we invent in our research.
This code marks my first attempt to freely share, in a useful way, the work of my PhD.


Installation and information
----------------------------

The `matlab/` subdirectory of this repository contains the source files.
After cloning the Git repository, you can simply add the `matlab/` folder to your Matlab
path in order to start using the code.

The documentation `matlab/magcode-matlab.pdf` contains both a user's guide and the
documented source code in a literate programming style.


Examples and test suite
-----------------------

The `examples/` subdirectory contains a number of files to illustrate the use of the `magnetforces` code (and other related things). These files are:

- `allag_torques.m` is an implementation of the theory of [Allag and Yonnet (2009)][1] for calculating the torques between cuboid magnets.
- `magnetforces_example.m` contains a reproduction of the results of [Akoun and Yonnet (1984)][2] and of [Janssen et al. (2009)][3].
- `multipole_compare.m` is an unfinished comparison between different configurations of multipole arrays.
- `multipole_example.m` is a reproduction of the multipole results shown by [Allag, Yonnet, and Latreche (2009)][4].

The source code contains a number of automated tests to ensure that future changes don't break existing functionality or start producing incorrect results. These are not included in the repository for clarity; extract them with `mtangle`.
