Magnetic spring with oblique magnets
====================================

This directory contains code for producing the graphs presented in the
publication `Theoretical analysis of a non-contact spring with inclined permanent magnets for load-independent resonance frequency`.

Figures 2 to 4 are generated with ‘oblique angles.m’; Figure 5 with ‘oblique gaps.m’; Figure 6 with ‘oblique h.m’; Figure 7 with ‘oblique gaps angles.m’; and Figure 8 with ‘oblique vol.m’.
