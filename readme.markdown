Calculating the force and torque between magnets
================================================

This repository contains code originally written for my PhD for calculating the forces (and now torques) between permanent magnets.

It has been originally written in Matlab, and I plan on adding translations into other programming languages as time permits.

Research
--------

The underlying maths of this work was not done by me but primarily by a group of French researchers over the last twenty-five years. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first attempt at presenting the work in a unified way, wrapped into a single interface.

Philosophy
----------

As time goes by, it becomes increasingly hard to build on the work of our predecessors unless we build tools to abstract the ideas we invent in our research. This code marks my first attempt to freely share, in a useful way, the work of my PhD.

Licence
-------

This work is freely modifiable and distributable under the terms and conditions of the Apache License v2. In effect, you are free to do with this code as you wish.
